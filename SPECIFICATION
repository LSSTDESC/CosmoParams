          COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONTAINER CLASS SPECIFICATION
        
                          v0.1 (2018-01-04)

This document specifies a basic container class for cosmological parameters. 
It may be implemented in any programming language. The important features of 
the specification are that (a) a base set of cosmological parameters is 
defined, with standardized names and meanings; (b) there are conditions to 
guarantee the consistency of the parameter values; and (c) the ways in which 
the class can be extended are specified, to ensure interoperability between 
different codes.


BASE SET OF PARAMETERS

The following parameters MUST exist as top-level members of the class. All of 
the parameters MUST be stored as floating point numbers (single or double 
precision). The names of these parameters MUST match the names defined here, including capitalization and underscores.

  (1)  Omega_c - Fractional density of CDM relative to critical density
  (2)  Omega_b - Fractional density of baryons relative to critical density
  (3)  Omega_m - Fractional density of all matter relative to critical density
  (4)  Omega_k - Fractional density of curvature relative to critical density
  (5)  Omega_l - Fractional density of Lambda/DE relative to critical density
  (6)  Omega_n_mass - Omega_nu for massive neutrinos
  (7)  Omega_n_rel - Omega_nu for massless neutrinos
  (8)  Omega_g - Fractional density of photons relative to critical density
  (9)  w0 - Dark energy equation of state (value at a=1)
  (10) wa - Dark energy equation of state (controls asymptotic value as a -> 0)
  (11) h - Dimensionless Hubble parameter
  (12) N_nu_mass - Number of different species of massive neutrinos
  (13) N_nu_rel - Effective number of massless neutrinos
  (14) mnu - Sum of neutrino masses, in eV
  (15) A_s - Primordial scalar power spectrum amplitude (dimensionless)
  (16) n_s - Spectral index of primordial scalar power spectrum
  (17) sigma_8 - Power spectrum amplitude, sigma_8

Notes:
 - Parameters (1)-(8) are defined with respect to the critical density at a=1.
 - The values of all parameters must be positive semi-definite (>=0), except 
   for parameters (4), (9), and (10).
 - Parameters (9) and (10) are defined under the assumption that the dark 
   energy equation of state is modeled as w(a) = w_0 + w_a (1 - a).
 - The normalization of the matter power spectrum may be specified using EITHER 
   parameter (15) or (17). The other parameter MUST then be set to a special 
   value (e.g. NaN or None) UNLESS it is treated as a derived parameter (i.e. 
   set to its correct value given the values of the cosmological parameters 
   that were specified). For example, if A_s was specified by the user, 
   sigma_8 must be set to NaN unless its value is subsequently calculated by 
   performing the appropriate integral over the linear matter power spectrum.
 - (FIXME): Parameters (6), (12), and (14) must be consistent. It is assumed 
   that any massive neutrinos all have identical masses.


DEFAULT VALUES AND CONSISTENCY CONDITIONS

Parameters (1), (2), (5), (11), and (16) MUST be given user-defined input 
values. They have no default values. One of (15) or (17) MUST also be given a 
user-defined input value (the other can be set to NaN/None, or can be derived; 
see note above).

Parameter (3) MUST satisfy the condition:
    Omega_m = Omega_c + Omega_b + Omega_n_mass

Parameter (4) MUST satisfy the condition:
    1 - Omega_k = Omega_m + Omega_l + Omega_g + Omega_n_rel

Parameters (6), (7), (8), (10), (12), and (14) have default values of 0.0.

Parameter (9) has a default value of -1.0.

Parameter (13) has a default value of 3.046.


EXTENSIONS OF THE CLASS

New parameters should occupy a distinct namespace from the base parameters.

Extensions may replace some of the base parameters, or make them obsolete. For 
example, an extension might describe a model where w_a is no longer a 
meaningful parameter. In this case <TODO>.
